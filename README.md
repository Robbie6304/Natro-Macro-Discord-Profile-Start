This python script can be used to start and stop your Natro Macro just by changing your discord online status. I made this as someone *cough cough slagger* did not feel like going through the tremendous effort of typing ?start on his macro before he went to sleep.

**How To Use:**
1. Create a discord bot and copy the token down
2. Create a file called "token.env"
3. Inside the token.env file, put DISCORD_TOKEN="Your_token_here"
4. Install dependencies (python-dotenv, discord.py)
5. Edit the USER_ID variable to be your discord UserId and the CHANNEL_ID variable to be the channel where your Natro macro is listening for commands.
6. run the python script!

By default the bot will start if you are on **Idle/Offline mode** and stop if you are on **Do not disturb/Online mode**
